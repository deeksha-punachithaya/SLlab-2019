ATM
Design a HTML form that displays user's current balance, an input field to enter amount and buttons to withdraw or deposit money. Validate the form such that i) Negative amount cannot be entered and Users cannot withdraw more than 5000 at one time ii) Users cannot withdraw amount greater than their balance and cannot deposit more than 10000 at one time. Also users can perform at most 5 transactions. Update the balance accordingly and ensure relevant data is not lost on closing the browser.

ShoppingCart
Shopping Cart Application: Design a simple Shopping Cart application which allows users to add items to their cart from a list of products. Allow users to view their cart (items and quantities of each). Ensure that items in the cart persist even after closing the application. On selecting buy, print out a bill of items in the cart. Perform any necessary validation. Demonstrate data persistence even after the browser is closed.

StudentReg
Design any case study that creates and validates a HTML form. On the server side, use Python to display the details entered by the user at the client side along with appropriate validation messages. Use Display appropriate messages if error occurs, and redirect to the another HTML page if successful.

DataScience programs - 

1. Student Performance
a) Load the ‘Student Performance’ dataset into one of the data structures (NumPy or Pandas).
b) Display header rows and description of the loaded dataset.
c) Remove unnecessary features (E.g. drop unwanted columns) from the dataset such as ‘lunch’ and
‘test preparation course’ .
d) Manipulate data by replacing empty column values in ‘parental level of education’ with a default
value.
e) Convert the attribute ‘race/ethnicity’ to have ‘groupA’ to be ‘Asian Students’, ‘groupB’ to be ‘African
Students’ , ‘groupC’ to be ‘Afro-Asian Students’, ‘groupD’ to be ‘American Students’ and ‘groupE’ to be
‘European Students’.
f) Perform the following visualizations on the loaded dataset:
i) Tally of the Number of Male & Female students who took up the ‘test preparation course’ and
those who did not.
ii) Total Number of Male & Female Students belonging to each student group
iii) No of students who ‘failed’(less than 40), ‘second class’(between 40 & 50).
‘first class’(between 60 & 75) and ‘distinction’(above 75) in ‘Maths’,
‘Reading’ and ‘Writing’.
g) Find the average Maths, Reading and Writing Score of each Group (Ethnicity

2. Black Friday
a) Load the ‘Black Friday’ dataset into one of the data structures (NumPy or Pandas).
b) Display header rows and description of the loaded dataset.
c) Remove unnecessary features (E.g. drop unwanted columns) from the dataset such as ‘User_ID’,
‘Product_ID ‘ ‘Stay_In_Current_City_Years’ .
d) Manipulate data by replacing empty column values in ‘City_Category’ with a default value for the
city.
e) Rename the attribute ‘City_Category’ to have ‘A’ to be ‘Metro Cities’, ‘B’ to be ‘Small Towns’ , ‘C’
to be ‘Villages’.
f) Rename the attribute ‘Product_Category_1’ to have ‘Baseball Caps’, ‘Product_Category_2’ to
have ‘Wine Tumblers’ and ‘Product_Category_3’ to have ‘Pet Raincoats’
g) Convert the attribute ‘Marital_Status’ to have ‘1:Married’ and ‘0:Un-Married’
h) Perform the following visualizations on the loaded dataset:
i) Tally of the Number of Male & Female persons who bought ‘Product_Category_1’ and
‘Product_Category_2’.
ii) Total Number of Male & Female persons belonging to each city category

3. Iris
a) Load the Titanic dataset into one of the data structures (NumPy or Pandas).
b) Display header rows and description of the loaded dataset.
c) Clean the data if applicable
d) Find the average petal width of each category of IRIS Species
e) Data Visualization for:
(i) How many flowers of each species exists for each value of sepal width
(ii) How many flowers are there whose petal width is <1, between 1 to 2 and >2
(iii) Tally the Iris-Versicolour and Iris-Virginica species according to the value of Sepal Width
